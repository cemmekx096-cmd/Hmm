║           VIP BYPASS STRATEGY GUIDE                      ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Based on the analysis, here are suggested bypass methods:

METHOD 1: Edit Smali Code (Recommended)
========================================

1. Locate VIP check methods in smali_classes11/
   → Look for: isVIP()Z, isPremium()Z, checkVIP()Z

2. Find the method in smali files:
   $ grep -r "isVIP" smali_classes11/
   
3. Edit the smali file:
   
   BEFORE:
   .method public isVIP()Z
       invoke-virtual {p0}, checkServerVIP()Z
       move-result v0
       return v0
   .end method
   
   AFTER:
   .method public isVIP()Z
       const/4 v0, 0x1    # Force return true
       return v0
   .end method

4. Repeat for all VIP-related methods

5. Recompile:
   $ apktool b modified_folder -o modded.apk
   $ uber-apk-signer -a modded.apk


METHOD 2: Remove Server Checks
================================

1. Find network/server code in classes11

2. Disable or remove server validation:
   - Comment out HTTP requests
   - Force offline mode
   - Always return "valid" response

3. This prevents VIP verification from server


METHOD 3: Patch libHMZ.so (Advanced)
=====================================

1. Extract strings from libHMZ.so
   $ strings libHMZ.so | grep -i vip

2. Use radare2 or Ghidra to:
   - Find VIP check function
   - Patch binary to always return true
   - This requires binary patching skills


RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
====================

Start with METHOD 1 (smali editing) as it's:
- Easier than binary patching
- More reliable than network blocking  
- Doesn't require root

Check the following files for specific locations:
→ vip_code.txt       - VIP code locations
→ smali_vip.txt      - Smali VIP methods
→ methods.txt        - Method signatures

Good luck!
